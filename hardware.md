# general computing
- my main computer that i do most of my work on is a thinkpad x260. it has a 6300U cpu and 8Gb of ram. it runs debian unstable, manjaro and windows for when i need to use shitty proprietary software
- i also use a thinkpad x200. it has an amazing keyboard so its great for writing latex documents. it's librebooted and has no proprietary software at all on it. its running devuan currently since parabola is shit

# games etc
i have a small form factor dell optiplex 3060 with an 8500T cpu
with 16Gb of memory. its useful to have a windows computer laying
about that i can play games with my friends on

# server
- my nas has a i5-9400t cpu. i went with the t version since it has a lower tdp and therefore it is cheaper to run. it runs truenas (formerly called freenas). it also runs all of my docker containers on a ubuntu server VM. it has 32gb of memory for a nice big zfs cache (ideal for when i upgrade to 10 gigabit later)! and is potentially upgradeable to 64gb. it has a passive cooler for quietness. 
- i also have a raspberry pi 3b+ running pihole and some torrent clients in docker it should be connected to a vpn all the time
- docker is shit, using systemd services is better, but docker is used a lot so i wanted to teach myself how to use it

(old pic from when i still had the dvd drive attached)

all my computers and servers are connected to my periferals with an expensive startech kvm switch. kvm switches are insanely expensive for some reason, especially dual monitor ones
